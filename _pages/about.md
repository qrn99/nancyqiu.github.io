Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I am **Nancy Qiu**, a Ph.D. student in Mathematics and Science Education ([MSED](https://sci.sdsu.edu/crmse/msed/home.html)) at San Diego State University ([SDSU](https://www.sdsu.edu/)) and UC San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)). My research spans inquiry-oriented mathematics education, mathematical modeling, and design-based research, with a focus on equity, collaboration, and student thinking.

Currently, I contribute to **NSF-funded projects** exploring how upper-division mathematics courses can better support future high school teachers. I also work with Dr. [Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) at [ProtoLab](https://protolab.ucsd.edu/) UCSD, where I explore crowdsourcing workflows to support collective intelligence. 

I received my Honours B.Sc. in Mathematics and its Application in Teaching, Statistics, and Computer Science from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and completed an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

Outside of research, I enjoy journaling and folding origami.

If you would like to chat, drop me an [email](mailto:nqiu5796@sdsu.edu)!
